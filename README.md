## How to run this website

In order to run the website you must have php and apache web services installed, which you can package install using xampp. This website uses mySQL in dbection
with php in order to complete all functionality beyond html, css, and javascript.
Once xampp and php and mySQL are installed, open the xampp console, and make sure verything is running. Change all of your applications from stopped to 'start'.

Once this is done, move the website words files into the htdocs directory in your xampp folder. Once this is done, give all of these files a folder in htdocs.
Now, the website can be ran by typing in the url 'localhost/myfoldernamehere'/

Now the website should be fully functional

## Bugs

There are no known bugs at this time, but I am sure there are many, especially with filtering input and malicious activity. I did not have time to cover this as it's not a requirement, but I wish I did, as I know how to filter and encapsulate my php dbections.

There are no known bugs with the current featurs, but could be any number of bugs overall.
