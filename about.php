  <h2>Sports Unlimited: Home of All Things Sports</h2>
  <p>Proudly brought to you by DanielMcDougall. I am a student at Boise State University pursuing a BS in Computer Science.
     More about me:

        I graduated high school in Portland, Oregon and moved out to Boise for the computer science degree, but I have fell in love with the city.
        I love dogs, football, and trying every restaurant/bar I can find. I find people in CS are so much cooler than they put on, you just have to
        get to know them... just like me!!!

        Here's a picture of my mates and I with good vibes, I'm the dude who abides on the right :) :
